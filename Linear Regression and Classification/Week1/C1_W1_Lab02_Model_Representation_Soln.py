import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('./deeplearning.mplstyle')


# # Problem Statement
# <img align="left" src="./images/C1_W1_L3_S1_trainingdata.png"    style=" width:380px; padding: 10px;  " /> 
# 
# As in the lecture, you will use the motivating example of housing price prediction.  
# This lab will use a simple data set with only two data points - a house with 1000 square feet(sqft) sold for \\$300,000 and a house with 2000 square feet sold for \\$500,000. These two points will constitute our *data or training set*. In this lab, the units of size are 1000 sqft and the units of price are 1000s of dollars.
# 
# | Size (1000 sqft)     | Price (1000s of dollars) |
# | -------------------| ------------------------ |
# | 1.0               | 300                      |
# | 2.0               | 500                      |
# 
# You would like to fit a linear regression model (shown above as the blue straight line) through these two points, so you can then predict price for other houses - say, a house with 1200 sqft.
# 

# Please run the following code cell to create your `x_train` and `y_train` variables. The data is stored in one-dimensional NumPy arrays.

# In[2]:


# x_train is the input variable (size in 1000 square feet)
# y_train is the target (price in 1000s of dollars)
x_train = np.array([1.0, 2.0])
y_train = np.array([300.0, 500.0])
print(f"x_train = {x_train}")
print(f"y_train = {y_train}")


# >**Note**: The course will frequently utilize the python 'f-string' output formatting described [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html) when printing. The content between the curly braces is evaluated when producing the output.

# ### Number of training examples `m`
# You will use `m` to denote the number of training examples. Numpy arrays have a `.shape` parameter. `x_train.shape` returns a python tuple with an entry for each dimension. `x_train.shape[0]` is the length of the array and number of examples as shown below.

# In[3]:


# m is the number of training examples
print(f"x_train.shape: {x_train.shape}")
m = x_train.shape[0]
print(f"Number of training examples is: {m}")


# One can also use the Python `len()` function as shown below.

# In[4]:


# m is the number of training examples
m = len(x_train)
print(f"Number of training examples is: {m}")


# ### Training example `x_i, y_i`
# 
# You will use (x$^{(i)}$, y$^{(i)}$) to denote the $i^{th}$ training example. Since Python is zero indexed, (x$^{(0)}$, y$^{(0)}$) is (1.0, 300.0) and (x$^{(1)}$, y$^{(1)}$) is (2.0, 500.0). 
# 
# To access a value in a Numpy array, one indexes the array with the desired offset. For example the syntax to access location zero of `x_train` is `x_train[0]`.
# Run the next code block below to get the $i^{th}$ training example.

# In[5]:


i = 0 # Change this to 1 to see (x^1, y^1)

x_i = x_train[i]
y_i = y_train[i]
print(f"(x^({i}), y^({i})) = ({x_i}, {y_i})")


# ### Plotting the data

# You can plot these two points using the `scatter()` function in the `matplotlib` library, as shown in the cell below. 
# - The function arguments `marker` and `c` show the points as red crosses (the default is blue dots).
# 
# You can use other functions in the `matplotlib` library to set the title and labels to display

# In[6]:


# Plot the data points
plt.scatter(x_train, y_train, marker='x', c='r')
# Set the title
plt.title("Housing Prices")
# Set the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Price (in 1000s of dollars)')
# Set the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Size (1000 sqft)')
plt.show()


# ## Model function
# 
# <img align="left" src="./images/C1_W1_L3_S1_model.png"     style=" width:380px; padding: 10px; " > As described in lecture, the model function for linear regression (which is a function that maps from `x` to `y`) is represented as 
# 
# $$ f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) = wx^{(i)} + b \tag{1}$$
# 
# The formula above is how you can represent straight lines - different values of $w$ and $b$ give you different straight lines on the plot. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> 
# 
# Let's try to get a better intuition for this through the code blocks below. Let's start with $w = 100$ and $b = 100$. 
# 
# **Note: You can come back to this cell to adjust the model's w and b parameters**

# In[31]:


w = 197
b = 110
print(f"w: {w}")
print(f"b: {b}")


# Now, let's compute the value of $f_{w,b}(x^{(i)})$ for your two data points. You can explicitly write this out for each data point as - 
# 
# for $x^{(0)}$, `f_wb = w * x[0] + b`
# 
# for $x^{(1)}$, `f_wb = w * x[1] + b`
# 
# For a large number of data points, this can get unwieldy and repetitive. So instead, you can calculate the function output in a `for` loop as shown in the `compute_model_output` function below.
# > **Note**: The argument description `(ndarray (m,))` describes a Numpy n-dimensional array of shape (m,). `(scalar)` describes an argument without dimensions, just a magnitude.  
# > **Note**: `np.zero(n)` will return a one-dimensional numpy array with $n$ entries   
# 

# In[32]:


def compute_model_output(x, w, b):
    """
    Computes the prediction of a linear model
    Args:
      x (ndarray (m,)): Data, m examples 
      w,b (scalar)    : model parameters  
    Returns
      f_wb (ndarray (m,)): model prediction
    """
    m = x.shape[0]
    f_wb = np.zeros(m)
    for i in range(m):
        f_wb[i] = w * x[i] + b
        
    return f_wb


# Now let's call the `compute_model_output` function and plot the output..

# In[33]:


tmp_f_wb = compute_model_output(x_train, w, b,)

# Plot our model prediction
plt.plot(x_train, tmp_f_wb, c='b',label='Our Prediction')

# Plot the data points
plt.scatter(x_train, y_train, marker='x', c='r',label='Actual Values')

# Set the title

# Set the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Price (in 1000s of dollars)')
# Set the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Size (1000 sqft)')
plt.legend()
plt.show()


# As you can see, setting $w = 100$ and $b = 100$ does *not* result in a line that fits our data. 
# 
# ### Challenge
# Try experimenting with different values of $w$ and $b$. What should the values be for a line that fits our data?
# 
# #### Tip:
# You can use your mouse to click on the green "Hints" below to reveal some hints for choosing b and w.

#     <ul>
#         <li>Try $w = 200$ and $b = 100$ </li>
#     </ul>
#     </p>

# ### Prediction
# Now that we have a model, we can use it to make our original prediction. Let's predict the price of a house with 1200 sqft. Since the units of $x$ are in 1000's of sqft, $x$ is 1.2.
# 

# In[34]:


w = 200                         
b = 100    
x_i = 1.2
cost_1200sqft = w * x_i + b    

print(f"${cost_1200sqft:.0f} thousand dollars")


# # Congratulations!
# In this lab you have learned:
#  - Linear regression builds a model which establishes a relationship between features and targets
#      - In the example above, the feature was house size and the target was house price
#      - for simple linear regression, the model has two parameters $w$ and $b$ whose values are 'fit' using *training data*.
#      - once a model's parameters have been determined, the model can be used to make predictions on novel data.
